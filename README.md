# real effects

Long story short, I took a class in Financial Macroeconomics at my University. As we went through different models, even the model of Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, 2022 Nobel winners along with none other than Ben Bernanke himself (it's been interesting to study a model while such was being credited in the same window of time), a model concerning "real effects" was presented.

I'm not going through the details right now, since I've already uploaded my notes (sorry but I lost the LaTeX file), however I wanted to compare how a variation of each variable would impact on the model, for both the Supply of Debt (DS) and the Demand (DB).
